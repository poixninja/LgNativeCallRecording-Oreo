# LG Native Call Recording Oreo

A simple Magisk module to enable native call recording for the LG V30/V30+ running Oreo.

**_This may cover the video call button for Verizon users, and will cover the contacts button for everyone else_**

## Prerequisites
* Magisk v19+

**_Note:_**
Tested on LG V30+ on stock LG Android 8.0.0. 
has been reported to work on LG v20, but may need mk2000 kernel

*Find "LG V30 Oreo Native Call Recording" listed there.
*Click on the download button (down arrow) and then click on "install". 
*Wait a few seconds for the download & installing to finish.
